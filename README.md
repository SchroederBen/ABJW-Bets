# ABJW Bets

## Overview
ABJW Bets is a data-driven sports betting decision support system designed to help users make informed wagering decisions using statistical analysis and large language models (LLMs). The system focuses on identifying positive expected value opportunities by combining historical data, real-time market inputs, and AI-assisted contextual analysis.

## Motivation
With the legalization of sports betting in Missouri, many bettors rely on intuition rather than research, leading to long-term losses. ABJW Bets aims to shift betting behavior toward structured, repeatable, data-driven decision-making.
